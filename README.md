These sat idle for over 2 years.

I wanted to put these out there for anyone who might want to use or build on them. I cant guarantee that they are all functional as I don't remember what I was still working on and what was finished product.  I haven't had time to play and miss Britannia greatly.  I will never forget how much joy it brought me over the years and hope to some day be able to return.

To those who where here before the release of moonstones, cheers to the best of times!
